title: flat
description: Flatten an array of arrays into a single dimension
---

import { SourceLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/SourceLinkAndPreview'
import { TestingLinkAndPreview } from '@/components/TestingLinkAndPreview'

## Basic usage

Given an array that contains many arrays, return a new array where all items from the children are present at the top level.

```ts
import { flat } from 'radash'

const gods = [
  ['ra', 'loki'],
  ['zeus']
]

flat(gods) // => [ra, loki, zeus]
```

Note, `_.flat` is not recursive and will not flatten children of children of children ... of children. It will only flatten `T[][]` an array of arrays.
